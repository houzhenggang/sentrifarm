PlatformIO configuration
========================

```
sudo apt-get install scons
sudo pip install platformio
platformio platforms install atmelavr #note, default
platformio platforms install espressif
platformio platforms install teensy
```

Note that downloaded toolchains install into ~/.platformio/packages/...

To make a new project:
```
cd projectdir
platformio init --board=esp01 --board=teensylc
```

Build & Upload:

```
platformio run 
platformio run --target clean
platformio run --target upload -e esp01
platformio run --target upload -e teensylc
```

Library Prerequisites
=====================

Note that downloaded toolchains install into ~/.platformio/lib/...

platformio lib install 417 # SPI4Teensy3 - GPL3 - I suspect the platformIO people havent thought through licensing...

PlatformIO Upload Notes
=======================
I dont know how it toggles reset / program etc. so need to do it manualluy



Arduino IDE Notes
=================

We are not using this anymore but I used it to test the module worked.
There is a known issue where the IDE leaves RTS(?) aka reset asserted, in some cases.
Also, picocom also leaves RTS asserted even when run with -fn
Picocom when run with -i may work if the IDE has not been used...
Workaround is to disconnect the RTS wire from the CP2102
The picocom problem may well occur with PlatformIO
